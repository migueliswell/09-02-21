# learning git
this repo is to learn and practice using **git** and **git hub**

## what is Git?
Git is a version control system, we utilize it to maintain the history of our projects as wekk as the different versions of it

## what is commit?
Acts as a checkpoint for our project  during the point in time. We can use **commits** to rollback changes to that point. **Commits** are how we are keeping track of our projects history.

## what is a push?
Pushing allows us to move any new commits to a remote repository. So in this case we can push out commits github

## Whar are branches?
Branches are different versions of our repo created from a commit. They allow us to work in different versions of our project simultaneously with others and keep our work independent. Master/Main branch is usually the default branch with the most changes.

## what is merging?
 Merging is taking the code from one branch and merging is to another. Usually we'll have feature branches that branched off the main beanch and we'll merge once the feature is complete.
